                <p>This section incorporates a colection of projects made for the courses Augmented Reality and Real-Time Animation.</p>
                <p>Each project has a video that was uploadeed to Youtube showing how the program runs and next to it there is a short description.</p>
                <p>Most of the programs were made using C/C++ and OpenGl and the shading was made in GLSL.</p>
                <p>There are also 2 programs made using Unity: The Semester Project for Augmented Reality and the Interactive Movie With Animated Character. </p>

                            <p>The application is a game with image targets, developed for Android devices. 
                                The application was created using Vuforia and Unity and then deployed and tested on an Android device (Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, 10.5‚Äù).
                            </p>
                            <p>To each image target a character was attached that is being displayed on the image of the card on the application is running. In this game the characters used were provided by the Unity Asset Store and are a Barbarian Warrior and a mummy that is displayed three times on three of the targets.</p>
                            <p>The aim of the game is to destroy the three mummies by using the barbarian character, that has the ability to move and shoot axes in different directions. Once a mummy is hit by an axe a health bar appears above it that allows the user to see how much life it has left. The health bar is created by using interface elements: canvas, panel and slider that are set to always face the camera, therefore the bar will always be visible regardless of the device movement. </p>
                            <p>Both the barbarian and the three mummies use scripts to enable special actions and features. The barbarian script enables the character to instantiate new axes as the user taps on the screen. The character can also be rotated and translated by using different finger movements. For the user input the LeanTouch library was used, also downloaded from the Unity Asset Store. The application also displays a UI interface that is overlaid on top of the game in the bottom of the screen. This interface provides two extra features that can be used for the character, namely power and angle</p>
                            <p>If all enemies are destroyed an animation attached to the object is played in a loop and a melody to let the user know that he won the game.</p>
                            <p>The mummy script checks for collision between the axes thrown by the barbarian and its own box collider. If a collision occurred the current health is changed and then displayed in the heal bar. A particle system attached to the game object will be put to play and then stopped in coroutine and a sound played. If the health bar reaches 0% the game object will be destroyed and will disappear of the marker.</p>

                            <p>The project is created in Unity.</p>
                            <p>The animation starts with an overview camera (Cinemachine Dolly Track camera) that films the entire scene and afterwards some State-Driven cameras are used to follow the character.</p>
                            <p>The animation of the character is triggered through script</p>
                            <p>More animations were added to the characters from Mixamo and then adapted in Unity for the character.</p>
                            <p>Face animations were added on a different layer of the characters
                                Animator controller. An animation mask was created to blend together different
                                animations so the facial animations could work together
                                with different body animations.</p>
                            <p>Physics with rigid body property was used to create the movement of the characters by adding
                                velocity to their respective rigid bodies.</p>
                            <ul>
                                The project displays some of the principles of animations:
                                <li><strong>squash and stretch - </strong>the little mummy (using keyframe animation)</li>
                                <li><strong>anticipation and exaggeration - </strong>facial expressions</li>
                                <li><strong>staging - </strong>cameras and sound</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A different script was created to incorporate the game behavior of the character. The movement of
                                the character was set at different speeds based on the character movement walking or running.
                                Different animations are blended together using blend trees. For running a different blend tree was created that blends together the running animations.
                                The mouse triggers the attack animation of the character by making the character twirl and hit with
                                its axe.</p>

                            <p>The ImGUI interface is used for manipulating the weights of the blend shapes.</p>
                            <p>The Eigen library is used for maths. The vertices, normals and indexes from every face are copied to 
                                Eigen::MatrixXf where every row stores one face.
                            </p>
                            <p>The weights received as input from the ImGUI interface are copied in an Eigen::VectorXf. The weight
                                on position zero is always set to 1. This weould actually represent the weight of the neutral face. This
                                weight is added only to make the multiplication possible between the matrix with all the faces and
                                the the weights vector</p>
                            <p>The transpose of the matrix is multiplied with the weights vector and the resulting vector will contain the
                               new vertices and respectively the new normals that will be used to draw the resulting face.</p>
                            <p>The animation is made by reading succesive weights from a file and generating the coresponding faces.</p>
                            <p>For the vertex picking part two functions were used one for calculating the ray direction and one for 
                                finding the intersections with the triangles in the object.</p>

                            <p>There is a hierarchical structure implemented between the plane and the propeller so the propeller can spin independently of the plane's movement.</p>

                            <p>The Gimbal lock for the euler angles can be achieved by doing a 90 degree roll and then a 90 degree
                                pitch. After making these rotations one degree of freedom is lost and the plane loses the ability to to
                                make a yaw rotation using Euler angles.</p>
