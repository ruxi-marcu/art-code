                            <p>The project is created in Unity. The environment and characters were taken from the Unity Asset
                                Store.
                                The animation starts with an overview camera that films the entire scene and after which focuses on
the main character of the movie. The camera at the beginning is a Cinemachine Dolly Track camera
The camera follows the desired path and then stops in front of the character after which some State-
Driven cameras are used to follow the character how he is pushing the chest and then moving
around to sit on a rock. For the state driven camera more virtual cameras were added that are
triggered by the different animations of the character. There are cameras for walking, sitting
throwing and idle state. All these cameras are mixed with normal cameras that were added at
different times in the timeline.
The animation of the character is triggered through script and also the chest pushing was made
through script.
The cameras for the next part of the movie are Unity cameras for which animations with keyframes
were made. The order in which each camera should be active in the scene is set through a timeline.
The timeline contains the cameras used in the scene and also the soundtrack. The sounds were
added to the timeline at the particular moment when they are supposed to play.
The character, the barbarian, come with some animations but more animations were added from
Mixamo. The model was uploaded in Mixamo different animations were chosen and then exported
without mesh to be used in Unity. After importing the new animations in Unity the animations had
to be changed to humanoid mode and adapted for the character in order to work properly.
The character also uses face animations that were added on a different layer of the characters
Animator controller. For the facial animations an animation mask was created to blend together the
animations from the two different layers and therefore the facial animations could work together
with different body animations resulting in a complex movement of the character.

The skeleton has its own script and animator controller. Different camera animations were created
in order to capture the different close-ups of the two characters and emphasize the facial
movements. At this point the character shows anticipation and exaggeration through its facial
features by having exaggerated expressions that show astonishment and then fear.

The cameras show the use of ease in and ease out. They use arcs and interpolate between different
positions and rotations.
The skeleton has its own script and its own animator controller. Different animations are triggered
from the script at particular times. The skeleton is displayed idle, dragging the chest, turning and
then walking towards the main character.
Both characters are rotated by using quaternions and euler angles to rotate their game objects.
Physics with rigid body property was used to create the movement of the characters by adding
velocity to their respective rigid bodies.
After running away from the skeleton, the barbarian encounters a little mummy that exemplifies one
of the principles of animation, namely squash and stretch. This animation was created by using
keyframe animation and creating a new animation for the mummy character.
After the entire animation is played the user is left to control the main character.
Particle systems were added to the scene in the spot where the character can be controlled by the
user. When the game starts fire can be seen by the characters feet.

The character can be controlled with the keyboard and mouse. The character can walk, run and hit
with its axe.
A different script was created to incorporate the game behavior of the character. The movement of
the character was set at different speeds based on the character walking or running.
The walking and running take as input values from the keys. Different animations for walking
straight, walking to the left, to the right and backwards are blended together using blend trees. For
running a different blend tree was created that blends together the running animations. In order to
make the character run, the shift key has to be pressed while also pressing the movement keys.
The mouse triggers the attack animation of the character by making the character twirl and hit with
its axe.
If there is no input from the user, the character returns to its default pose and that animation runs in
a loop.

                            <p>ASSIGNMENT2 - TRANSMITTANCE EFFECTS
                                The program uses a cubemap as the environment of the scene. The cubemap uses its own shader for
                                displaying the cube and the textures.
                                The application loads three objects (.obj files) a car, a teapot and a cube. The transmittance effects,
                                Reflection, Refraction, Chromatic Dispersion and Fresnel, are all implemented in the shader files. The
                                program can change the shaders by using the keyboard with the keys ‘t’ (reflection), ‘y’ (refraction),
                                ‘u’ (Chromatic Dispersion’) and ‘I’ (Fresnel) so the effects can be changed and seen on all the objects
                                while the program is running.
                                The shader files create the transmittance effects by using the texture from the environment namely
                                the textures of the cubemap.
                                The program can also animate the objects by generating a rotating motion of the objects if the key
                                ‘p’ is pressed.
                                The scene can be manipulated by the use of the mouse and keyboard allowing movement within it
                                and giving the possibility of viewing the objects from different angles.
                                Libraries
                                The libraries used for making the program are glfw, glew and stb_image, glm.
