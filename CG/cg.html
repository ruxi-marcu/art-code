                            <p> The transmittance effects: Reflection, Refraction, Chromatic Dispersion and Fresnel, are all implemented in the shader files. </p>
                            <p> The shader files create the transmittance effects by using the texture from the environment namely
                                the textures of the cubemap.</p>
                            <p> The scene can be manipulated by the use of the mouse and keyboard allowing movement within it and also the shaders can be switched while the program is running.</p>

                            <p>Glitter or subtle glints are present in many materials. It applies both to dramatically glittery
                                surfaces like glittery materials snow, craft glitter, metallic crafts and paints, but also to
                                surfaces that present the same shifting in glints without actually being considered glittery.
                                Less obvious glittery surfaces include everyday glossy materials. For example a standard
                                power adapter presents bumps on its surface that create glints that appear and disappear with
                                changes in viewpoints and lights. This kind of materials would appear too smooth in close-up
                                without their specific glints.</p>

                                    a normal texture is used to create some forms
                                on the object’s surface very similar to the surface of an object with crafted glitter on top.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Metallic paints - </strong>
                                    present multiple layers layers out of which at least one contains microflakes.

                                    present subtle glints based on the angle of view.
                                    To get the distinct sparkles that can be seen in snow a noise function was added to the texture
                                that perturbs a grid pattern with some noise and with the view vector to let the glittering
                                change based on the angle of view. This noise tries to imitate the specific glints present in
                                snow. The glitter and sparkle effects are added to the final output colour.
