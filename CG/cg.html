                        <p>1 - REFLECTANCE
                            I have created a scene into which I loaded two obj files a teapot and a star.
                            The scene is displayed in 3 different viewports.
                            For every viewport the objects are displayed with a different type of reflectance. The 3 types
                            implemented are, from left to right, Blinn-Phong, Toon, and Cook-Torrance.
                            I have implemented two different light sources, one with blue color and one with pink at different
                            distances from the objects.
                            The animation of the objects can be turned on and off by using the ‘p’ key.
                            The specular, diffuse and shininess parameters can be increased or decreased from the keyboard
                            while the animation in running, using the keys ‘a’,’z’,’s’,’x’ and ‘d’,’c’.
                            The specular and shininess parameters are available only for Blinn-Phong and the diffuse parameter
                            is common for both Blinn-Phong and Toon.
                            For Cook-Torrance none of the 3 parameters will have any effect, since they are all calculated based
                            on the distance from the light sources.
                            For Cook-Torrance the object can be changed to appear either plastic either metallic, also from the
                            keyboard with the keys ‘h’ and ‘n’.>

                <p>ASSIGNMENT2 - TRANSMITTANCE EFFECTS
                    The program uses a cubemap as the environment of the scene. The cubemap uses its own shader for
                    displaying the cube and the textures.
                    The application loads three objects (.obj files) a car, a teapot and a cube. The transmittance effects,
                    Reflection, Refraction, Chromatic Dispersion and Fresnel, are all implemented in the shader files. The
                    program can change the shaders by using the keyboard with the keys ‘t’ (reflection), ‘y’ (refraction),
                    ‘u’ (Chromatic Dispersion’) and ‘I’ (Fresnel) so the effects can be changed and seen on all the objects
                    while the program is running.
                    The shader files create the transmittance effects by using the texture from the environment namely
                    the textures of the cubemap.
                    The program can also animate the objects by generating a rotating motion of the objects if the key
                    ‘p’ is pressed.
                    The scene can be manipulated by the use of the mouse and keyboard allowing movement within it
                    and giving the possibility of viewing the objects from different angles.
                    Libraries
                    The libraries used for making the program are glfw, glew and stb_image, glm.
                </p>

                <p>ASSIGNMENT3 - BUMP AND NORMAL MAPPING
                    The application loads a cubemap as the environment for the scene.
                    Within the scene it loads three different objects from obj files, a humanoid figure, a teapot and a
                    box.
                    For every object the tangents and bitangents are calculated and used to display three different
                    normal textures. The normal textures are loaded by using 2 dds files for diffuse and specular texture
                    and one bmp file for the normal part of the texture. The shaders display the textures on the objects.
                    The scene can be manipulated from the keyboard giving the possibility of movement within the
                    scene and viewing the objects from different angles.
                    The objects can be animated by use of the keyboard. Pressing the ‘p’ key stats and stops the objects
                    rotation.
                    The texture of the objects can be modified from the keyboard allowing us to see the objects with
                    normal mapping and without. It can clearly be seen that there is a huge difference and this
                    difference is emphasized even more when the objects are rotating and the light falls on them in a
                    different way.
                    Libraries
                    The libraries used for making the program are glfw, glew and stb_image, glm.

                <p>ASSIGNMENT4 - MIPMAPS
                    The application shows the differences in texturing types name, with and without mipmaps.
                    The program loads an obj file, a plane, and sets on it a checkerboard texture. The plane can be
                    rotated to view the texture from different angles.
                    The settings for the loadTexture function can be changed from the keyboard to one of the following:
                    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR);
                    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST);
                    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
                    glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
                    The change in texture is more obvious if the plane is very tilted
    
                    Libraries
                    The libraries used for making the program are glfw, glew and stb_image, glm.
